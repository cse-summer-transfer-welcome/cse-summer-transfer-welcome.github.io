## Week 3

Hi everyone!

Happy week 3ish/4ish of the summer series! Hope your summer is going great as always.

🧑‍💻 **Livestream**

Thanks for your responses to the welcome survey (which you can still fill in, see the link later in this message!). Thursday evening was by far the most popular time for a live online meeting. So I'm going to stream on Twitch this Thursday evening (tomorrow, August 3rd) starting at 7:30pm Pacific. The link is:

[https://www.twitch.tv/profjoeucsd](https://www.twitch.tv/profjoeucsd)

(Why Twitch? A few reasons. It doesn't require you to log in or open a separate app like Zoom and plays just from the browser. It *does* have chat, which is nice if you want to make an account and discuss things. It's easy to save and share recordings. I can set up my screen a little more flexibly than with Zoom screenshare. Also, I want to try it out, I haven't done it before!)

I'm planning a mix of live-coding, focused on C programming, and any Q&A you have. I'll probably go for an hour and a half or two hours, and I'll send a reminder when I get started. I'll schedule future ones based on what we learn from this one.

✅ **Things to do This Week (Do One, Some, or All!)**

It seems like most of you are targeting CSE30 as an incoming class. With that in mind, I think it'll be useful to do a bit of C programming.

So for this week:

- Review this video with a solution to `Stats.java` from last week: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DHOuGt5iA4
- Come to the livestream this Thursday (tomorrow!) evening
- Review the “Arrays and Strings” section of “Dive into Systems” https://diveintosystems.org/singlepage/#_arrays_and_strings
  We'll use some of that material on Thursday and probably assign some related practice problems.
- Join Discord if you want to meet + chat with others – also you can use Discord to direct message questions during the livestream. Join Discord with [https://discord.gg/scphSBUac](https://discord.gg/scphSBUac)
- Join EdStem via [https://edstem.org/us/join/qVgKFU](https://edstem.org/us/join/qVgKFU) if you haven't already! There's a place to try out `Stats.java` and (now) there is a submission button labeled “Mark” that you can press – I'll give some coding feedback on submitted solutions. (This button was accidentally hidden, thanks to those of you who asked about it!)
- Complete the welcome survey if you haven't already (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMoUZWUWpCoOjqO2uhRNAwR1ARmd1ZsqjkmbZ12liBglpgHg/viewform)

🔗 **Resources & Quick Links**

- The department has faculty advising office hours where you can chat with faculty about classes, logistics, research, and more. Check out the advising hours (most are remote) via the calendar on this page:
  https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/advising/undergraduate-committee-ugcom-advising-and-mentorship
  (My office hours are Monday at noon if you want to stop by and chat!)
- Did you know many classes are recorded? You can watch past class recordings by logging in with your @ucsd account at [https://podcast.ucsd.edu/](https://podcast.ucsd.edu). Try searching under “Past Classes” for a course you're interested in if you want a preview!

## Week 1

Hi!

If you're getting this, you're an incoming transfer student into UCSD CSE – welcome!

My name is Joe Politz, I'm a professor at UCSD CSE.

This email is the first in a series we'll be sending out over the next few weeks as part of the CSE Summer Series: [https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/cse-summer-series](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/cse-summer-series)

🗓 **Format and Content**

The goals are:

- to get you connected with resources in our department and university (including each other!)
- to share some content that will help you prepare for fall

We'll do this via some videos, some online quizzes and programming work, and more.

Here's the video for this welcome:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68HpZ9OfTHU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68HpZ9OfTHU)

This program is entirely free (it's literally just the advising staff plus me sending emails and running a few accounts) and there's no registration or anything. You can engage as much or as little as you like, and there's no penalty for “missing” a week or anything.

✅ **Things to do This Week (Do One, Some, or All!)**

Each week will come with some TODOs; you can do none, one, some, or all of them as you find useful!

- Fill out the [welcome survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMoUZWUWpCoOjqO2uhRNAwR1ARmd1ZsqjkmbZ12liBglpgHg/viewform):  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMoUZWUWpCoOjqO2uhRNAwR1ARmd1ZsqjkmbZ12liBglpgHg/viewform
- Join the Discord server: (use newer link above) (If you're new to Discord, it's this: https://discord.com/)
- Join EdStem and try out the “Week 1 Quiz”: https://edstem.org/us/join/qVgKFU
	- (Week 1 quiz link: https://edstem.org/us/courses/41515/lessons/70328/slides/376319)

You can ask questions by replying directly to this email, or by asking on EdStem or on Discord!

## Week 6

Hi all!

I'm back (if a little late this week 😬) with more summer studies goodness.

It's time to talk about runtime!

☑️ **Things to Do This Week (Do One, Some, or All!)**

-   Watch two videos on measuring and calculating runtime [[1]](https://youtu.be/_5AVXWN_cyY) [[2]](https://youtu.be/kxmCdhrCj8g) (these are from a lecture in CSE12)
-   Complete the section on [Time Complexity](https://stepik.org/lesson/692933/step/1?unit=692543) in Stepik
-   Complete the programming practice (and quiz questions!) in Summer Programming Practice Week 6 on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). (The solution for last week's programming practice is included as part of that quiz).

-   **Bonus:** I also uploaded the automatic grader for [PA7 from CSE11](https://ucsd-cse11-f21.github.io/assignments/pa7.html) on Gradescope (it shows up as "pa7" in the assignment list). It's a great way to see what it's like when you upload a coding assignment that gets automatically graded in our courses. Some folks have mentioned wanting more practice with interfaces, and it's also a great assignment for that. It has milestones designed in, so you can do just part of it and still learn a lot.
-   Do something [from a past week](https://cse-summer-transfer-welcome.github.io/) -- it's not too late to get started!

**![🔗](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/14.0/1f517/72.png) Resources & Quick Links\
**

It's time to register for classes! Reach out to a [CSE advisor](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-advising) if you have questions or troubles with enrollment!

☑️ **TODO**

-   Watch three videos on Lists and ArrayLists [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvAxaTYUzDs) [[2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwH0Qvl0gR0) [[3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dsTEYDPlfs)

-   Read the chapter on [ArrayLists on Stepik](https://stepik.org/lesson/687833/step/1?unit=687068)
-   Complete the programming practice described in the Summer Programming Practice Week 5 on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/)
-   Review the quiz answers in Gradescope (you can see your quiz graded if you submitted, and if you make a new submission or update your submission you'll see automated feedback)

-   Do something [from a past week](https://cse-summer-transfer-welcome.github.io/) -- it's not too late to get started!

## Week 2

Hi everyone,

It's Joe again from UCSD CSE. I hope your summer is going well – here is your
second weekly summer studies update! It's been so great to hear from so many of
you already via the survey, Gradescope, and Discord.

☑️ Things to Do This Week (Do One, Some, or All!)

- Review your quiz answers below; ask questions on Discord to clarify anything
  that was confusing!
- [Watch the video introducing this week's content](https://youtu.be/ugjz3mEKLQs), then complete and upload the
  assignment described in the video (upload to Gradescope). The assignment is
  the Stats.java part of [PA5 from CSE11](https://ucsd-cse11-f21.github.io/assignments/pa5.html)
- That might involve setting up Java on a computer you use – you can follow
  the instructions from [CSE11 PA1](https://ucsd-cse11-f21.github.io/assignments/pa1.html) to do that (Part 1 - Setting Up)
- Work on [Chapters 9 and 10](https://stepik.org/lesson/579631/step/1?unit=574281) of the CSE 11 texbook, which are related to using
  Java at the command line.
- Go to the [CSE Summer Transfer Series Research Panel](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/summer-transfer-series) tomorrow, July 21 at 12:00pm

The programming practice is due by July 26 because I'll release answers, give feedback, and start discussing it on July 27. Ask on Discord with questions/if you get stuck!

Also complete anything from the week 1 message (included at the end). You can start any time!

👨‍🏫Quiz Review (Spoilers!)

These videos go over the first half of the quiz questions from last week:

- [Q2.1 (References 1)](https://youtu.be/Lpxym6SBD74)
- [Q2.2 (References 2)](https://youtu.be/t3vvf1U2tjo)
- [Q2.3 (Interfaces)](https://youtu.be/csk4A0DU-kE)
- [Q2.4 (Command-line Arguments)](https://youtu.be/3wI16EFzEI0)

(I'll go over the second half of the questions in a future week more focused on
data structures; this week focuses on material related to Q2.4.)

There is also an [attached PDF with the questions and and
answers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ytQbq5LamMp4b9BFpBi9wJlfC8dgZNKc/view?usp=sharing)
for quick viewing, [the notes from the
videos](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UR0bu7m1tEbI24a8kw9-rdQqxBnkp2yI/view?usp=sharing),
and a [running
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLomrLWUG1p5Oe0V4ePwB_FimUCCOZHs9N)
of videos that I will keep updating.
