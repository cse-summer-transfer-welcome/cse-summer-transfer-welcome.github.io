## Week 3

Hi all!

Hope your summer is going well! Joe here, back with more summer studies excitement.

‚òëÔ∏è Things to Do This Week (Do One, Some, or All!)

- Watch this [recorded lecture video](https://youtu.be/ukR_QETXq4I) from [CSE11 about interfaces](https://ucsd-cse11-f21.github.io/lectures/lecture10.html) (and a feel for what an in-person lecture looks like!)
- Work on [chapter 8](https://stepik.org/lesson/574307/step/1?unit=568892) of the CSE11 textbook about interfaces
- Complete Summer Quiz Week 3 on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) (about... you guessed it... interfaces!). You can also give us feedback via this quiz!
- Do something [from a past week](https://cse-summer-transfer-welcome.github.io/) ‚Äì it's not too late to get started!

üë®‚Äçüè´ Programming Practice Review (Spoilers!)

Check out the video reviewing the programming problem from last week. There's also a direct link to the [code from the video](https://github.com/cse-summer-transfer-welcome/cse-summer-transfer-welcome.github.io/blob/main/Stats.java).

If you submitted your solution to Gradescope, I'll get you feedback on your code this week!

If you tried and struggled with this, feel free to direct message me on Discord, ask on the general channel on Discord, email me, or come by my [office hours](https://jpolitz.github.io/contact/) with questions.

A featured resource this week is [CSE Prof Advising Office Hours](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-committee-ugcom-advising-and-mentorship), where you can talk to profs in the department about courses, research, industry, and more!

## Week 2

Hi everyone,

It's Joe again from UCSD CSE. I hope your summer is going well ‚Äì here is your
second weekly summer studies update! It's been so great to hear from so many of
you already via the survey, Gradescope, and Discord.

‚òëÔ∏è Things to Do This Week (Do One, Some, or All!)

- Review your quiz answers below; ask questions on Discord to clarify anything
  that was confusing!
- [Watch the video introducing this week's content](https://youtu.be/ugjz3mEKLQs), then complete and upload the
  assignment described in the video (upload to Gradescope). The assignment is
  the Stats.java part of [PA5 from CSE11](https://ucsd-cse11-f21.github.io/assignments/pa5.html)
- That might involve setting up Java on a computer you use ‚Äì you can follow
  the instructions from [CSE11 PA1](https://ucsd-cse11-f21.github.io/assignments/pa1.html) to do that (Part 1 - Setting Up)
- Work on [Chapters 9 and 10](https://stepik.org/lesson/579631/step/1?unit=574281) of the CSE 11 texbook, which are related to using
  Java at the command line.
- Go to the [CSE Summer Transfer Series Research Panel](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/summer-transfer-series) tomorrow, July 21 at 12:00pm

The programming practice is due by July 26 because I'll release answers, give feedback, and start discussing it on July 27. Ask on Discord with questions/if you get stuck!

Also complete anything from the week 1 message (included at the end). You can start any time!

üë®‚Äçüè´Quiz Review (Spoilers!)

## Week 1

Hi!

My name is Joe Politz, I'm a teaching professor in CSE at UCSD. Since you're an
incoming CSE transfer student, we'd like to provide you some free weekly
resources and check-ins to help you get super-ready for fall.

The content is directly related to what we do in our courses, and it's also a
way to meet some of your fellow incoming students! And as a bonus, if you
complete enough of the work you'll get some cool CSE swag when you arrive in
the fall üôÇ

üóì Format and Content

Quick overview video:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGic1t47Jvg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGic1t47Jvg).
In brief, we'll send an email like this every week with video(s), resources,
and some activity you can complete, and there's a chat server for Q&A.

You can participate as much or as little as you like, and I hope to convince
you that ‚Äúmuch‚Äù will prepare you well for fall quarter!
